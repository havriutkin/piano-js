# piano-js

## Description
In this project I implemented piano using HTML, CSS and JS.

## Some technical details
CSS grid was used to create piano layout. 
Site is responsive, piano looks good for different viewports.
List of strings that reprsent notes names is stored in script.js. Function playNote finds corresponding audio file and plays it.

## Ideas for future development
1. Add different piano sounds
2. Add sound effects (reverb, eq, etc.)
3. Add different color schemes
